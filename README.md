## Background

Picking up on the concept of [MLH-Fellowship/ttp-team-4-2: Meltman (github.com)](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/ttp-team-4-2), an entry for the 2020 MLH Fellowship Introductory Hackathon which was never entirely finished due to the time limited nature of a hackathon. 
The entry won 2nd place out of 10! 
The original team consisted of myself, [**victorFFFF**](https://github.com/victorFFFF), and [**chunhz** ](https://github.com/chunhz).
